 ghost is an iOS app which enables the user to play the game "Ghost" ([wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(game))) on his or her iPhone. The game was written in Swift 2 using Xcode 7.0.1 and tested using simulated and actual iPhones.

To try the app you can download the files and open them in Xcode.

When the app is started for the first time it may take some time to load both lexicons, but this is made up for by not having to load every during game play (when the app is closed it will have to load the lexicons again, but this won't take as long as the first time, since the app won't have to read the lexicon from the .txt-files, but can load it out of a saved instance).
